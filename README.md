I'm an undergraduate Informatics Engineering student with a broad interests in tech field. Currently I'm focusing on iOS development and put some energy in front-end development along with back-end development.

I love to do experiments with web frameworks and build trivial stuffs for fun. Sometimes youâ€™ll find me doing art stuffs like design and illustration.
